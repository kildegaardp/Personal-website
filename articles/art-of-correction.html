            <h1>The Art of Correcting Mistakes</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Sports is full of mistakes. A shot goes wide. A serve hits the net. A pass finds the wrong teammate. The result is immediately visible and felt, and everyone tries to diagnose it. What went wrong? How do we fix it?</p>

            <p>What I've learned across years of competing and coaching: most corrections don't work. Not because the diagnosis of the mistake is wrong. They don't work because we're correcting the wrong things.</p>

            <h2>One-Time vs. Repeated Mistakes</h2>

            <p>I believe that there are two types of mistakes in sports: one-time mistakes and repeated mistakes.</p>

            <p>The problem is that each of these mistakes require very different reactions, but that most athletes and coaches are bad at distinguishing between them.</p>

            <p>They see a mistake once and immediately try to fix it. They see a mistake repeatedly and continue to let it happen. We treat noise as signal, and signal like it's fragile. We react aggressively to one-time errors and cautiously to patterns.</p>

            <p>Whether to correct at all, and how hard to push, depends entirely on which type of mistake you're dealing with.</p>

            <h2>One-Time Errors Don't Need Fixing</h2>

            <p>A striker takes a shot that goes wide. Everyone sees it, including the player, and the natural response is to diagnose and correct immediately. "You were leaning back." "Stay over the ball." "Plant your standing foot closer."</p>

            <p>The problem is that a single mistake isn't necessarily a problem. There can be tons of reasons for a shot going wide—a slip in focus, an awkward bounce, pressure from a defender. Correcting it immediately treats a one-time error as if it requires immediate change.</p>

            <p>This creates three issues.</p>

            <p>First, the correction might be wrong. If the error won't repeat, any adjustment is unnecessary and potentially harmful. The player who shot wide once might naturally hit the next three on target or even inside the near post. Now they're working on a problem that doesn't exist.</p>

            <p>Second, constant correction creates confusion. When every mistake triggers immediate feedback, athletes lose the ability to distinguish systematic issues from random errors. They start trying to fix everything at once, which means they fix nothing effectively.</p>

            <p>Third, it trains both coach and athlete to be reactive rather than intentional. Instead of working on predetermined priorities—the technical patterns that actually matter—training becomes a series of small adjustments chasing whatever happened most recently.</p>

            <p>The rule is simple: don't correct the first time. Wait to see if it repeats. If it doesn't, it wasn't worth addressing. If it does, now you have a pattern worth working on.</p>

            <h2>Overcorrect Repeated Mistakes</h2>

            <p>Once a mistake becomes a repeated pattern, the dynamic reverses. Now both players and coaches tend to under-correct.</p>

            <p>This seems counterintuitive. If you've identified a real pattern — shots consistently going wide, a defender repeatedly getting caught too high up the pitch — why wouldn't you address it aggressively?</p>

            <p>The answer is that changing ingrained behavior is extraordinarily difficult for both player and coach. Players have built muscle memory, habitual movement patterns, and deeply embedded technical responses. Coaches see new mistakes emerge and naturally shift their focus. Both sides need to work against natural tendencies: the player against automatic movement, the coach against the pull of new observations.</p>

            <p>As a coach, your job isn't just to create awareness — it's to help the player bridge the gap between awareness and implementation. This means being persistent with feedback, giving it often, and helping the athlete not just understand what needs to change but actually make the change stick.</p>

            <p>As a player, the strategy is even more counterintuitive: you need to deliberately overcorrect.</p>

            <p>Think of it like guessing a number between 0 and 1000. If your first guess of 20 is too low, guessing 21 next is a terrible strategy. You'll be told "higher" hundreds of times before you find the answer. The efficient approach is to make big leaps—guess 500, then 750, then 625. Overshoot in one direction, then overshoot in the other, until you bracket the right answer.</p>

            <p>The same logic applies to technical correction. As my tennis coach used to say: "You always have to make the opposite mistake. If your serve goes into the net, your next serve has to go in or be long." This is important for two reasons:</p>

            <p>First, you're probably not overcorrecting as much as you think. Your body's habitual pattern is strong. What feels like a massive change is often barely enough to shift the behavior.</p>

            <p>Second, even if you do overshoot and hit it long, now you've established a range. You know what too low feels like and what too high feels like. Finding the right balance between those extremes is much faster than inching up from the net.</p>

            <h2>Different Mistakes, Same Approach</h2>

            <p>The framework applies to more than just technical mistakes. The same logic — ignore one-time errors, overcorrect repeated patterns — works for tactical decisions, physical habits, and mental patterns.</p>

            <p><strong>Technical:</strong> A goalkeeper consistently dives too early on penalties. Don't tell them to wait "a bit longer." Tell them to wait until it feels uncomfortably late, until they're almost certain they've waited too long. They need to experience what "too late" feels like to find the right timing.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical:</strong> A midfielder keeps getting caught too high up the pitch when the opponent counterattacks. The incremental fix—"Drop a meter or two deeper"—rarely works. Instead, spend a training session staying absurdly deep, almost playing as a center back. Make the opposite mistake deliberately. Once they've felt what "too deep" is, they can find the right balance.</p>

            <p><strong>Mental:</strong> A player is too cautious, too worried about making mistakes. Telling them to "relax" or "be more confident" does nothing. Instead, give them explicit permission to make mistakes. Set a target: "I want you to lose the ball at least three times trying ambitious passes today." They need to experience what happens when they push too far before they can calibrate properly.</p>

            <p>The pattern repeats: one-time errors get ignored, systematic problems get attacked with deliberate overcorrection. The type of mistake changes, but the approach doesn't.</p>

            <h2>The Real Work</h2>

            <p>Often, the hard part isn't seeing what's wrong. Coaches can diagnose problems accurately. Athletes can feel when something is off. The diagnosis is usually correct.</p>

            <p>The hard part is knowing when to act and how hard to push. We want to help immediately, but most mistakes don't need immediate correction. We want to adjust carefully, but careful adjustments rarely overcome ingrained patterns.</p>

            <p>It requires discipline to wait for patterns to emerge. It requires courage to deliberately overshoot when you find them. But the alternative — constantly adjusting to one-time errors and incrementally nudging patterns — keeps everyone trapped in the same place.</p>

            <p>Ignore the one-time mistakes. Overcorrect the repeated ones. That's how behavior actually changes.</p>
